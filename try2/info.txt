first training:
epsilon=0.9
decay=0.99
gamma=0.9
mem=1000
epsilon_min=0.01

rewards:
eat=10
dead=-10
live=0.1

subsequent training:
epsilon=0.005
decay=0.99
gamma=0.9
mem=1000
epsilon_min=0.005

rewards:
eat=10
dead=-100
live=0.01

gen0: average score = 1.42, best score of resulting weights = 37 (outside training)
gen1: not run till the end (199 games) -> weight_31_1.h5
gen2: crash no more memory -> Reduce gain on live to 0?
